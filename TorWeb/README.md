## Get The Domian

Tor Automatically generates a `.onion` domain for you and it is a random `56` character long string. Though you can customize it but thats another story.

The Domain Name is stored in the `tor/hidden-service/hostname` file. You can `cat` it to get the domain.

Or just run the `domian.sh` script. i.e.:
```bash
bash domain.sh
```

If there is no `package.json` file then at first initialize the node project and install the dependicies
```bash
npm init -y
npm i express dotenv body-parser
```
and ass the start script in the `package.json`
```json
{
...
  
"start": "node index.js"
